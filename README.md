# niche-userscripts
A bunch of userscripts created either by me, friends, or with AI (usually either Gemini or ChatGPT). Appropriate credit will be in the Author and any comments as needed.

# Browse Bing *without* AI
### Wait, you can do that?? In today's world!?
Honestly I liked using Bing for the rewards as I do use them.   
But I draw the line at forced AI useage.    
* Could I choose another Search provider?   
> Yes, you're right, I could.    
  But I don't always want to and I should be able to search on      whatever search engine I prefer *without* needing to have AI      suddenly shoved down my throat on an engine I've used prior to    the AI implementation.    

Try out [Remove-Bing-Chat-AI.user.js](https://github.com/Jakesta13/niche-userscripts/blob/main/Microsoft%20Sites/Remove-Bing-Chat-AI.user.js)    
If you notice Co-Pilot appearing in specific situations, add an issue and make sure to remark the userscript the issue is about.    
All I would need is     
* A screenshot **of** the placement    
* Entire element **or** element ID/Classes.
* If there's anything also to click such as X boxes, include the entire element **or** Element ID/Classes and specify.     
 > Element ID: id="element ID"    
 > Classes: class="classes"

<sub>I'm also thinking about making a userscript to tackle Gemini on Google Search</sub>
